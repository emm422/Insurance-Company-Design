# Insurance-Company-Design

## Summary
This project mimics the functionality of an insurance company specifically for homes, boats, and cars. The project employs JDBC and Java to connect to a SQL database which stores all information for the insurance company - the database is structured based on the ER Diagram shown below. Through this interface, users can interact with the insurance company and perform specific role-based functions.
